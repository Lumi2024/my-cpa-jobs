    Remote work continues to grow in 2026, but so do scams and misleading job offers.
    Knowing how to identify legitimate opportunities is essential.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Avoid upfront payment requests</h2>
  <p>
    Legitimate employers never ask candidates to pay fees to apply or get access
    to job listings.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Research the company</h2>
  <p>
    Always check official websites, reviews, and online presence before applying.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Be cautious with unrealistic promises</h2>
  <p>
    Jobs promising extremely high income for minimal effort are often misleading.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Use job aggregation platforms</h2>
  <p>
    Aggregator websites can help you compare opportunities and access multiple
    listings in one place.
  </p>

  <p>
    Job Finder aims to make this process easier by organizing publicly available
    remote job opportunities.
