  <p>
    Job Finder is an independent job aggregation website focused on remote jobs,
    online work, and flexible income opportunities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our goal is to collect publicly available job listings and present them in
    a simple, easy-to-browse format for people looking for remote or location-independent work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Job Finder is not an employer and does not hire candidates directly.
    We simply provide informational listings and redirect users to official
    application pages.
